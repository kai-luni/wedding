  <!-- TRANSPORTATION SECTION -->
  <section class="wedding-info">
    <h2>Transportation in Thailand</h2>
    
    <h3>Local Transportation</h3>
    <p><strong>Tuk Tuks:</strong> Fun to experience but overpriced! Great for short rides and photos, but don't rely on them for regular transportation.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Taxis:</strong> Fine and cheap for getting around the city. Avoid the waiting taxis in front of malls or tourist areas, and always make sure they activate the taximeter before starting your journey.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Motorcycle Taxis:</strong> An adventure for the brave! These are fast and can navigate through traffic, but make sure to negotiate the price beforehand. Hold on tight!</p>
    
    <p><strong>Grab Taxi:</strong> Relatively expensive nowadays, but it's a secure and convenient way to get from A to B. Good for when you want reliability and don't want to negotiate.</p>
    
    <h3>Long Distance Travel</h3>
    <p><strong>Minivan:</strong> This is what the Thais use a lot for far distance travel. Very cheap and reliable - a great way to travel like a local!</p>
    
    <p><strong>Overnight Train:</strong> My personal favorite! They are slow but convenient, and you'll arrive at your destination in the morning. It's a unique experience and you save on a night's accommodation.</p>

  <!-- SIM CARD INFORMATION SECTION -->
  <section class="wedding-info">
    <h2>Internet & Communication</h2>
    
    <h3>SIM Cards</h3>
    <p>At Suvarnabhumi Airport in the baggage claim hall, there's an excellent SIM card shop near Carousel 19. Here you can buy unlimited internet packages depending on how long you're staying. The friendly staff will either insert the physical SIM card into your phone or help you set up an eSIM directly - very convenient!</p>
    
    <p>Packages are available from major providers (AIS, DTAC, TrueMove) starting from 300-500 THB. You can also find SIM cards at convenience stores throughout the city if you prefer to get one later.</p>

  <!-- MONEY & PAYMENT SECTION -->
  <section class="wedding-info">
    <h2>Money & Payment</h2>
    
    <h3>How to Pay</h3>
    <p>Cash is king for tourists in Thailand! While locals commonly use QR code scan apps for payments (like PromptPay), these digital payment systems aren't easily accessible for tourists. Most local restaurants, street vendors, and smaller shops expect cash payments.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Credit Cards:</strong> You can use credit cards in many shops and larger establishments, but fees vary significantly by store. For example, 7-Eleven charges a 200 baht fee every time you use a credit card, while stores like Decathlon don't charge any additional fees. Because of these variable and sometimes high fees, it's best to use credit cards only when necessary and rely primarily on cash for most purchases.</p>
    
    <h3>Getting Cash in Thailand</h3>
    <p><strong>Bring Thai Baht from Germany:</strong> Your bank in Germany can exchange Euros for Thai Baht before you travel. This is often convenient and gives you cash ready to use upon arrival.</p>
    
    <p><strong>ATMs in Thailand:</strong> You can withdraw cash from ATMs throughout Thailand, but be aware that fees are quite high and vary between different banks and ATM operators.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Currency Exchange:</strong> Bring Euro in cash for the best exchange rates at these recommended exchange shops:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Thaniya Gold Shop</strong> - <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/mesUachdwNbsxWRo8" target="_blank">View on Google Maps</a></li>
      <li><strong>Siam Exchange</strong> - <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/EGWYdxeJK6XfekFt6" target="_blank">View on Google Maps</a></li>
    </ul>

  <!-- RESTAURANT SECTION -->
  <section class="wedding-info">
    <h2>Restaurants & Food</h2>
    
    <h3>SoupSoup Restaurant</h3>
    <p>We highly recommend trying this unique restaurant experience! Here's how it works: when you enter, you choose from a variety of fresh ingredients that go into a bowl. At the cash register, you then select the cooking style for your ingredients. From the pictures below, you can see two popular options: Japanese shabu soup and fried kimchi. Once you've made your selections, the finished meal will be brought directly to your table.</p>
    
    <p>It's a fun, interactive dining experience that lets you customize your meal exactly how you want it!</p>
